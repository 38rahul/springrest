--> it is used to consume Restful web services.
Rest template is a class and this class is used to create the Application that consume rest full web services.
To communnicate between 1 microservuces to another microservices.

Question: What do you mean by consume ?
--> Assume that we have certain Api or rest full web services running somewhere in a server and inside your Application you want to consume that API 
	response or you want to use that Api response then for that we have to use a rest templat class.
	
 
	So, Rest template is a class and it is used to create a Application which consumes or uses the response from the other Restful web services.

	Question: How can we use this ??
	---------------------------------
	For that we have certain methods by which we can use this rest template to consume the rest full web services 
	
	------------------------------
	Before Moving to the methods I would like to show you constructors for creating the object of a rest template
	
	-------------------------------
	Basically there are 3 ways to create the instance of the Rest Template
	
	1: RestTemplate()
			-> we don't pass any arg. inside constructor. Used to create instance of the RestTemplate using default Settings
			
	
	2: RestTemplate(ClientHttpRequestFactory requestFactory)
			-> create a new instance of the RestTemplate based on the given ClientHttpRequestFactory
	
	3: RestTemplate(<>)
	
	
	-----------------------------------
	
	I will create 1 controller inside the controller package
	And I will create 1 Service class inside the service package
	and then inside my new  controller i will use the rest Template and then I will show you How we can consume all these
	rest full web services end point over Different Controller.
